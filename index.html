      <p>This is my first webpage I have coded and uploaded. It was a bit tricky trying to figure out everything. I didn't want to spend any money and luckily GitHub Pages was there. I got signed up and thought i was ready to go. I made a mistake with the free account and chose to make the webpage private at first. That created 30 mins of me waiting for it to just never load. :( I deleted the previous attempt and started over and just followed a youtube video from 2017 step by step. It lead me to getting this up and out. I"m now ready to continue learning code. The HeadFirst Html and CSS book chapter 4 said I had to find somewhere to upload and to uploade to continue. :)</p>
